	<ul> <h1><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h1>
		<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
		<li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
		<li>4 slices bacon, chopped</li>
		<li>1 pound chicken tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>4 plum tomatoes, chopped</li>
		<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
		<li>5 ounces baby spinach</li>
		<li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
	</ul>

	<ol> <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1></p>
		<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fettuccine according to package directions; drain.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, put the bacon in a large, cold skillet, then cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crispy, about 8 minutes; transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. </li>
		<li>Sprinkle the chicken lightly with salt and pepper and add to the skillet in a single layer. Let cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the underside, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to the plate with the bacon.</li>
		<li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cream and bring to a simmer, then add the spinach and stir until just wilted. Add the bacon, chicken, fettuccine and Parmesan and toss with tongs until well coated; season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with basil and serve.</li>
