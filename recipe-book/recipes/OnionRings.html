<h1>Description</h1>
	<p>These Crispy Air Fryer Onion Rings are the hands down the BEST we have ever eaten. Homemade onion rings are so good, especially when you make them in an air fryer. Less oil does not mean less crispy. You can even make them spicy too.</p>

	<ul> <h1><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h1>

		<li>Flour</li>
		<li>Eggs</li>
		<li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
		<li>Seasoning</li>
	</ul>

	<ol> <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1></p>
		<li>Slice your onion. Start by slicing off the top of a large onion with a sharp knife, then peel away the outer layers of papery skin. Carefully slice the onion into discs that are between 1/4″ and 1/2″ wide on a cutting board, then separate them into individual rings.</li>
		<li>Prepare dredging stations. Gather three shallow bowls or shallow dishes (these are pasta bowls that work great because they have a slightly higher lip to contain everything). In one, combine flour, cornstarch, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour the buttermilk into another dish, and add the Panko breadcrumbs to the third.</li>
		<li>Dredge in flour, then buttermilk. The onion slices are usually moist enough to pick up a nice amount of the spiced flour mixture on their own without dipping them in buttermilk or beaten egg mixture first, but you can always soak the onions for 30 minutes in the buttermilk, drain well, and then dip them in the flour before dipping a second time in the buttermilk. I usually find it easiest to just go straight to the flour first though.</li>
		<li>Coat in breadcrumbs. Let the buttermilk drip off the onion rings for a sec before transferring them to the bowl of breadcrumbs. Toss to coat the onion rings all over. You might want to press a few breadcrumbs in to make sure you get a solid coating.</li>
		<li>Heat oil. Heat 1- to 2-inches of oil to between 350 and 375°F over medium-high heat. You can use a deep cast iron skillet, dutch oven, or deep fryer, if you have one. The oil temperature might need to be adjusted as you add the onion rings to it, so just watch it and try to keep it in that range so the onion rings fry properly.</li>
		<li>Fry onion rings. Work in batches to from 4-6 onion rings in a single layer at a time without overcrowding the pan, which can cause the oil temp to drop significantly. Fry each batch of onion rings for 2-3 minutes or until they are golden brown and crisp. Carefully transfer them with tongs or a slotted wire spatula for frying to a wire rack set over a baking sheet lined with paper towels to soak up any excess oil that drips off. Repeat until all of the onion rings have been fried. </li>
