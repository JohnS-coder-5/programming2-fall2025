			<p>The Red Cross Club is a student-led organization dedicated to serving our school and community through compassion, leadership, and action. We support the mission of the American Red Cross by organizing blood drives, hosting donation events, promoting emergency preparedness, and engaging in community service projects. Our members learn valuable leadership and teamwork skills while making a real difference in the lives of others. Whether it’s raising awareness, volunteering, or lending a helping hand, we work together to bring hope and care to those in need. </p>
