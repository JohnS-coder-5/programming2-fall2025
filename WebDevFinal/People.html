			Here we have our founder! A hardworking and dedicated indivudal who has his heart set on justice. This passion followed him through his education and into his legal career, shaping the way he approaches every case. Now that he has finally gotten his law firm up and running, he is more motivated than ever to put his values into action. David is excited to serve his community and fight for those who need a strong voice in their corner. His commitment, determination, and strong moral compass drive everything he does. For him, this firm is more than a business, it is the realization of a lifelong goal.

			Here we have our Attorney, Henry. Previously having thought of himself to be going down the medical road of life, he now finds himself here. Coincidentally enrolling in the same school as our founder, they have been able to form a bond over the shared interest of making an impact, and as those interests blossomed, so did the idea of this law firm.
