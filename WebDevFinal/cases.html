<!-- CASE 1  -->

	<div class="biosnimgs">
			
		<div class = "bios"> 
				Here we can we see a very distraught lawyer. This is due to him finding out he has to go againts our expert lawyers. If this doesnt show our ferocity and accomplishments in our field, I dont know what else could change your mind.

	</div>

<!-- CASE 2  -->

	<div class="biosnimgs">
			
		<div class = "bios"> 
				Here is a massive victory, so big in fact that the lawyers hugging one another arent even our lawyers celebrating a verdict, rather they are the opposing lawyers hugging in joy due to finally having the opportunity to see their families after our lawyers kept them glued to this case for months.

<!-- CASE 3  -->

	<div class="biosnimgs">
			
		<div class = "bios"> 
				What you see before you is a retired lawyer speaking to a group. He is not retired due to his age, matter of fact he is only 32, but our legal team has drained the years from him, resulting in his very early retirement. He know spreads our team's non-ending momentum to anyone who listens.

<!-- CASE 4  -->

	
	<div class="biosnimgs">
			
		<div class = "bios"> 
				Here you can see a prosecutor arguing his lies. However our excellent lawyers know exactly how to defend againts this tactic, by presenting cold hard facts and making sure they resonate with the jury. Actually, the jury is stunned just by the presence of our outstanding lawyers, causing them to miss whatever lies the prosecuter was spewing.

<!-- CASE 5  -->

	<div class="biosnimgs">
			
		<div class = "bios"> 
				The witness on the stand is utterly terrified of our lawyers, both of them ready to pick at his words meticulously. Once the witness was done talking, with just one glare from our lawyers, he said "I made all that up, im a liar", and fled the courtroom. Resulting in a swift victory.
